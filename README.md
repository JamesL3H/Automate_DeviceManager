# Automate_DeviceManager
Automating Windows 10 Device Manager using Pywinauto

I'm trying to automate a few tasks that are done once a week on a few test stations.
One of those tasks is to open Device Manager, click View, then Show hidden devices.
Next I need it to open Network adapters.
From there I'll right click to Uninstall certain devices.
